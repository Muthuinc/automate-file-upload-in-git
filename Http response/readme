1.) Execute the script file.
2.) The script will give response about the URL. just type the domain name without www.
3.) it is made for the task given. but it can be scalable. 
4.) Error responses are stored in an array. so if anyone want to add more like  503: Service         Unavailable , 504: Gateway Timeout . Just add the error in the NUMARRAY in the script folder. and its custom response in MUMARRAY.
